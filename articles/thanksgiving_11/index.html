				<p>I spent Thanksgiving very simply this year. There was no turkey shopping, no slaving for hours in the kitchen, and no frantic rush to set and serve a table of eager eaters.</p>
				
				<p>Normally, my mother does her best to put together a great, big meal for a handful of people. All the energy that goes into it exhausts her. For the past few years, I've done my best to help her with the prep and cooking, but she ends up feeling drained and under-appreciated in the end. By the time we all sit down to eat, she wants nothing to do with the meal.</p>
				
				<p>This year, I urged my mother not to spend her time off hovering around an oven and stovetop. She thanked me for understanding. Instead, my mother bought a premade meal that required just a bit of oven time. I love food, so I thanked her for still doing something.</p>

				<p>On Thanksgiving, we picked up the food and took it to my grandmother's. In previous years, we wouldn't see her until after dinner, when we'd bring over what we had. The three of us dined together on Thanksgiving for the first time in years. Grandma thanked us for this.</p>

				<p>Believe me, Thanksgiving food has a special place in my heart&mdash;stuffing and candied yams, especially. The meal, however, is a representation of the holiday and it's too easy to forget that. Seeing my mother happy on Thanksgiving was a wonderful change. Feeling my grandmother's joy at having the meal with us was incredibly rewarding, as well. Sure, the food wasn't as good but we were all happy. This year, without all the stress involved, we were able to take a step back and appreciate it all the more.</p>

				<p>I hope your Thanksgiving was great. I hope your food was perfect and I hope you spent it with as many of your loved ones as you could fit in a room. I hope, most of all, that you were able to appreciate everything in life that brought you to that table.</p>
