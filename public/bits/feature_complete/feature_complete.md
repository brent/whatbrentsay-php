Remember a while ago--too long ago, admittedly--I mentioned that I was [building a content management system][1] for this very web site? Last night, I squashed my last major bug. My "CMS" is basically feature complete (more on why that's in quotes later). 

I made a thing. 

That's not something I get to say often.

Ironically, even though I checked off all the features I initially decided I needed, I still have a long list of features I'd like to have. I also have a nice list of bugs to fix, but that's a given. The more time I spent working on this, the more things I wanted to do with it. I'm pretty sure that's not going to change, either. I'll continue to add things as they move from the want column into the need column.

What does this mean? Two things. 

I'm hoping to open source this "CMS" for anyone who happens to have the same specific need for the exact problem I set out to solve. It's a quirky thing and maybe not entirely friendly, but if you like what you see here and want to make something similar, it could be an option. More details on that will come when I explain why "CMS" is in quotes. That'll happen after I take a fine toothed comb through the codebase and write some documentation. For those of you who are interested in the technical details, it's a file based system written in PHP, uses [Twig][2] for templates, and can parse [Markdown][3].

It also means there's going to be more content here, probably a lot more of these bits on a somewhat regular basis. Articles will come when they come, but hopefully more often, as well. I've invested time building this, so I'll keep on keepin' on even if you don't come back and read the next thing, though I hope you do.
