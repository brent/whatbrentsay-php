Toothpaste, 

You constantly conspire against me. You masquerade as the white knight of oral hygiene, doing your part to keep my teeth from prematurely rotting out of my mouth (except for that one time, but that wasn't your fault--another story entirely). I appreciate your efforts in that cause. Why do you ruin the taste of apple juice, my favored morning beverage of choice, then? You know how much enjoyment this sweet nectar brings me yet each day you ensure that it becomes a foreign substance born of foul hatred. I'm onto you, toothpaste. I had hoped it would not come to this but it has. Your insubordination has been noted. Do not forget your place in my kingdom.

Coldest regards,
Brent
