Today, Apple announced a new iPad which they are fittingly calling the iPad--no numbers, no letters, no combinations of both. You go to the store and ask for an iPad and you get a shiny new new iPad with all its bells and whistles in the size and network configuration you choose. You can also walk into that same Apple store and ask for an iPad 2 and you'll get just that--a shiny new old iPad with all the bells and whistles it had when it came out in whatever size and network configuration you want.

Go to the store, ask for an iPad 2 and you get year old hardware. Go to the store, ask for an iPad and you get new hardware. That's weird, right?

Now, I think I understand why Apple is doing this. My guess is that they're simplifying their product names to reflect the way they update all their other products. MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, Apple TVs, iMacs, Mac Pros, iPod Touches, iPod Minis, etc. are all product lines that see generational revisions without numbers, so why should the iPad (and eventually the iPhone) be any different?

Well, it shouldn't. It just seems like a bit of a blunder the way they handled keeping the iPad 2 around with the new iPad. An easy solution would've been to allow customization options for the iPad like their computers (it is a "post PC" product, after all). You hit the iPad page, choose if you want a retina display or not (which locks you into 3G or 4G), then you pick your size, and lastly your carrier. All the devices are just called iPads--no confusing, contrary numbering.

I know, I know, this is nitpicky. However, it seems like a rare mishap for a company that always seems to make very purposeful decisions to introduce a potentially confusing situation for their customers. Then again, was it clear to the average consumer that the iPhone 3GS was better than the 3G? Was it clear that the iPhone 4S was better than the 4? That may very well be the reason the numbers and letters are going away.
