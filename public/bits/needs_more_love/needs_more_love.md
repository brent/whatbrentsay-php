I very recently started reading [Frank Chimero][1]'s [The Shape of Design][2]. I'm a big fan of him. Sometimes, I say--half jokingly--that I want to be like him when I grow up. While I haven't read every book on design, I can already say with confidence that Chimero's book reads nothing like any other book on design out there. And it reads wonderfully because of that.

Early in the book, he shares a moment back at university where he asked a preoccupied professor to review his portfolio. After looking through the work, Frank's professor took a moment away from the phone call he was on to say, "needs more love," and then shooed him away. The sentences that followed leapt off the page at me:

>"My work was flat, because it was missing the spark that comes 
>from creating something you believe in for someone you care 
>about. This is the source of the highest craft, because an 
>affection for the audience produces the care necessary to make 
>the work well."

He couldn't be any more right.
