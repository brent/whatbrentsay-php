I know a lot of rumors suggested a $249 - $299 price point. If you thought the iPad Mini was going to be around $249 then you don't understand Apple's vision for the product and the way they're going to market it. (Note: I had assumed a $349 price point, so I wasn't exactly on the mark, myself.)

The iPad Mini costs more than most would _like_ it to be. It's not prohibitively expensive, though. With the iPad Mini, Apple had to do something it doesn't do--enter a space that was already established. 7" tabletps have existed before the Mini so it's more of a reactionary product. It's not a bad product for that reason. On the contrary, I expect it to do well against its competitors. But who doesn't, right?

There's a reason that conclusion is obvious: it's an iPad. If we're to believe Sir Jony Ive, it's everything an iPad is meant to be without any concessions--[concentrated, not reduced][1]. Whether you're inclined to believe the rhetoric, that's key to understanding the price. For all intents and purposes, the Mini is an iPad 2 (which still costs $399) in a smaller body.

Furthermore, the Mini is not priced competitively with its rivals because it's--again, the rhetoric--a better product. It brings with it a bigger screen that's more usable and doesn't introduce any app incompatibilities. It hits the ground running with the entire iPad tablet app ecosystem which has significantly more tablet specific apps than any other platform. Additionally, it comes in a size that allows one handed use but still weighs less than its competition, despite being a bit larger.

And let's not forget that Apple is a brand that sells luxury hardware. Apple has never been the company to turn to when you want the best monetary value. You pay for the end to end marriage of beautiful hardware, fun, intuitive user experience, and innovation (this one's debatable with the Mini). That is Apple's definition of luxury.

On all the points Apple cares to market, the iPad Mini is a better device across the board. On top of that, it has the distinct advantage of being an iPad. The iPad Mini's only competition, in the eyes of Apple, is its 9.7" big brothers (which is a challenge in its own right).

Believe me, I'd love to see a $249 iPad Mini. I would rush out to get one at that price, just like many other people. At $329, however, I'm still not in the territory of immediate no. The full sized iPad has always been too expensive for me to justify, so I have never owned one. Many have been able to justify that price, though. A $329 price point makes it even easier to own--and justify the cost of--an iPad, albeit a smaller one.
