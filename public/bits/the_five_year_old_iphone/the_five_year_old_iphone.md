I cannot believe it's been five years since the first iPhone was released. It feels like the device has been around forever; it's already so ingrained in our culture in such a natural way. Five years is a long time in the tech world--long enough to change the entire landscape of mobile software and hardware, apparently. I've been seeing a few retrospective articles pop up and wanted to share some of the reminiscing.

[Macworld has a nice retrospective][1] written by their original iPhone reviewer.

And [The Verge has a timeline of the evolution of iOS][2] all the way up present day.
