I've been bad at tending to my corner of the interwebs. In an attempt to remedy that, I'm going to try a weekly round up of things I come across on the web. You can call this first installment the proof of concept, but I can already say that the format for this will evolve if I continue doing it (because, frankly, this format is less than ideal for this kind of content).

Disclaimers aside, here's a bunch of things that have happened in the last week in mostly chronological order.

* * *

**[Rumor has it Google will unify their communications services into one, called Babble](http://androidandme.com/2013/03/news/google-to-unify-existing-communication-platforms-into-one-app-babble/)**

Maybe they'll actually come up with a next gen communications suite that doesn't go the way of [Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_wave). [Ars](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/babble-google-may-be-priming-unified-chat-service-for-google-io/) and [Mashable](http://readwrite.com/2013/03/19/google-rumored-babble-service-could-become-eclipse-imessage/) have picked up the rumor, as well.

* * *

**[Bungie says they're not worried about Destiny's always online requirement](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/18/bungie-not-concerned-about-destinys-always-on-connection/)**

Considering the unquestionable SimCity's launch turned out to be, I'm hoping Bungie will avoid a similar fiasco when Destiny launches. [Everything](http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/5/21/3035138/bungies-next-game-destiny-xbox-360-in-2013) [that](http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/17/3993058/destiny-bungie-first-look-preview) [has](http://www.bungie.net/en-us/Destiny) [been](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams) [revealed](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/17/bungie-reveals-destiny-an-always-on-persistent-world-adventu/) about Destiny [so far](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/17/destiny-what-we-know-now-vs-details-in-the-activision-bungie-con/) has been intriguing and given Bungie's track record, I have a lot of confidence that they can pull it off.

* * *

**[Google launches a note taking service called Keep](https://drive.google.com/keep/)**

[Rumors pointed to Keep's existence](https://plus.google.com/105300064640552437108/posts/eqbhWDxBRX4) and a few short days later, it was revealed to the world. It's a pretty barebones personal content store--like Evernote with less features--that syncs with Google Drive. [There's an Android app, too](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep).

* * *

**[Team Fortress 2 is adding support for the Oculus Rift](http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/18/4119954/team-fortress-2-oculus-rift-vr-mode/)**

I'm excited about the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/). The Rift will seem gimmicky and excessive to many and it'll face an uphill battle for gamers' adoption depending on its retail price, but dammit it's a really cool piece of technology.

* * *

**[T-Mobile doesn't want to act like a wireless company anymore](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4120462/t-mobile-march-26th-uncarrier-event-new-york-city)**

T-Mobile is holding an event on the 26th where they're rumored to be revealing a contract free structure ([the plans are live now](http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/individual-plans.aspx)), payment plans for phones, and officially launch their LTE network. 

The best things I've heard about T-Mo in recent memory have all revolved around their prepaid offerings. Embracing this model sounds like a good move as long as they can ensure coverage and speed is competitive.

* * *

**[Want to interact with a 3D map of the internet? There's an app for that.](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/what-internet-looks)**

* * *

**[Some birds may be evolving to avoid getting hit by cars](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/birds-are-evolving-not-get-hit-cars)**

It's wild to see how human intervention affects nature as it's trying to do its thing.

* * *

**[Google updated their Android Gmail app](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/reply-and-search-faster-with-gmail-app.html)**

The update offers faster search and the ability to archive and reply straight from email notifications.

* * *

**["Hidden" positions in basketball](http://www.wired.com/playbook/2013/03/basketballs-hidden-positions/)**

Really interesting read about categorizing players based on their skill sets rather than the vague labels positions offer. With players like LeBron James defying the boundaries of their positions, it's definitely a more sensible way to describe a player.

* * *

**[The Great Discontent interviewed Trent Walton last week](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/trent-walton)**

If you design things, you should read this because Trent Walton is awesome.

* * *

**[Andy Rubin, co-creator and chief of Android since 2005, is stepping aside to work on a secret project](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4120208/why-andy-rubin-android-called-it-quits)**

The Verge has a great feature about Rubin and his involvement with Android as the mobile OS has grown and evolved.

* * *

**[A visual story of Nike's Air Max sneakers](http://nikeinc.com/news/airmax-matt-stevens-celebrates-the-reinvention-of-air-max#/inline/18485)** (via [@jedmund](https://twitter.com/jedmund))

I'm not a huge fan of the Air Max, but the illustrations here are really quite nice.

* * *

**[A look at SportsVU, an analytical camera tracking system being used in the NBA](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9068903/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution)**

Great read, especially if you're interested in some of the ways teams use analytical data to perform better. 

There's also this gem in there about the NBA's resident superhuman player (emphasis added):
> The Heat have three of the best wing defenders in the league in Shane Battier, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, and the latter two are among the NBA's most gifted pure athletes. James can mimic DeRozan's hyperactive ghost in a way no other player can, Rucker says. "**LeBron basically messes up the system and the ghosts," Rucker says. "He does things that are just unsustainable for most players**." 

* * *

**[Curiosity Rover keeps on keepin' on after being in safe mode for a couple of days](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4125290/mars-curiosity-rover-back-to-active-status-after-safe-mode-standby)**

If you haven't been paying attention to some of the images and data Curiosity has returned to us, [you should take a look sometime](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/images/image-collection_archive_1.html). Seriously, _this thing is on another planet_.

* * *

**[You can now filter Google Image results for animated gifs](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57575145-93/google-images-adds-filters-for-animated-gifs/)**

[Rejoice](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/yea-fuck-yea.gif).

* * *

**[Nvidia is getting more aggressive as they look beyond just building GPUs](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4123636/nvidia)**

I doubt they'll "light up every pixel" like they want to, but they've been making big strides with their Tegra processors (and also taking a leap with [Project SHIELD](http://shield.nvidia.com/), their mobile gaming product).

* * *

**[Twitter has been granted a patent on itself, basically](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124888/twitter-gets-a-patent-on-twitter)**

Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone are the inventors listed on the patent which 
> broadly describes a messaging service in which users follow each other and sent messages don't have specific recipients, but are rather sent and displayed to those followers by the system itself.

Despite [Twitter's stance on using its patents only to defend rather than instigate](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/twitters-no-lawsuit-pledge-we-will-not-join-the-patent-wars/), this is a very powerful patent to hold.

* * *

**[Amazon is getting into the streaming music service business, too](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124702/amazon-talks-to-record-labels-about-subscription-music-service)**

Join the party--so are [Apple](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/7/4075566/apple-streaming-music-service-reportedly-delayed-as-licensing-talks-break-down) and [Google](http://bgr.com/2013/03/06/google-streaming-music-service-warner-361591/).

* * *

**[Samsung officially confirms that they're working on a smart watch product](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/samsung-preparing-wristwatch-as-it-races-apple-for-sales.html)**

Their goal is to beat Apple to market (Apple's [smart watch](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/12/3982446/apple-smartwatch-team-has-100-people-bloomberg) [has](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/12/27/apple-and-intel-working-on-bluetooth-smart-watch-for-2013-launch/) [been](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/27/rumor-apple-building-bluetooth-smart-watch/) [heavily](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21547947) [rumored](http://mashable.com/2013/02/10/apple-smart-watch/)). Oh, and [Google's making one, too](http://www.androidcentral.com/google-reportedly-working-entry-smart-watch-market).

* * *

**[Double Fine is making a game for the Leap Motion Controller](http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/19/4124768/dropchord-teaser-trailer-double-fine-leap)**

Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in the trailer but the [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/) is another really cool piece of technology. Like the Oculus Rift, I'm just happy to see developers adopting it.

* * *

**[Amazon may be building a private cloud for the CIA](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4127618/amazon-reportedly-building-a-private-cloud-for-the-cia)**

So&hellip; the next time AWS [suffers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/24/netflix-crippled-on-christmas-eve-by-aws-outages/) [an](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/aws-ec2-issues-in-north-virginia-affect-heroku-reddit-and-others-heroku-still-down/) [outage](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/30/there-goes-the-weekend-pinterest-instagram-and-netflix-down-due-to-aws-outage/) we may lose the CIA, too?

* * *

**[Statistically speaking, it's hard for some scientists to believe we're alone in the Universe](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/aliens-the-definitive-guide_n_2909012.html)**

I can definitely see the rationale. There's so much out there, it almost feels selfish to say that we're the only intelligent life anywhere in the Universe. Until we know for sure, Science Channel specials like the one described in the article will have to do.

* * *

**[Is Starbucks having trouble rolling out Square's--a company they invested $25m in--services to its stores?](http://www.fastcompany.com/3005410/industries-watch/starbuckss-shoddy-square-rollout-baffles-baristas-confuses-customers)**

With such a huge investment in Square, it's hard to believe there's still this kind of unfamiliarity with it at Starbuck's locations.

* * *

**[The Voyager I space probe has left our solar system](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4127728/humanity-reaches-beyond-the-solar-system-voyager-1)**

Amazing. It took 35 years for the probe to do it, but it's an incredible testament to human engineering and curiosity.

* * *

**[This is the set up necessary to cover every single March Madness game](http://gizmodo.com/5991476/the-insane-one+man-computer-station-needed-to-cover-march-madness)**

The pictures say it all.

* * *

**[Jimmy Fallon, the next host of the Tonight Show?](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tonight-returning-nyc-fallon-hosting-article-1.1294400?localLinksEnabled=false)**

I wonder how Conan feels about this

* * *

**[Really nice vintage inspired travel posters](http://www.creativebloq.com/posters/lovely-vintage-inspired-travel-posters-3132208)**

* * *

**[Twitter turned 7 last week](http://mashable.com/2013/03/21/happy-7th-birthday-twitter/)**

Time really does fly. I can't believe Twitter has been around for that long already. Hell, [I can't believe how long the iPhone has been around](http://whatbrentsay.com/bits/the_five_year_old_iphone).

* * *

**[Draw a stranger's Facebook profile picture or let them draw yours](bits/the_five_year_old_iphone)** (via [@ryanbed](https://twitter.com/ryanbed))

This looks like it could be a lot of fun. I haven't tried it yet, but its a tab that's been open in my browser since it came up in my Twitter feed. Give it a try if that's your kind of thing.

* * *

**[If you watch the NBA and are familiar with JR Smith, you should watch this video and read its accompanying commentary](http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/55306/must-watch-the-sexiest-j-r-smith-music-video-on-the-internet)**

If you're not an NBA fan, you should pass. Otherwise, it's from Grantland; of course it's good.

* * *

**[Beyond: Two Souls' graphics are incredibly realistic](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4130832/quantic-dream-beyond-two-souls-preview-willem-dafoe-ellen-page)**

I don't own a Playstation 3, which means I probably won't get to play this game, but that won't stop me from being mesmerized by how realistic this game's graphics are. What amazes me even more is that the next generation of consoles will be coming soon and they will be even more capable by quite a bit.

* * *

**[The Motorola/Google "X Phone" surfaces (maybe)](http://androidandme.com/2013/03/smartphones-2/this-is-the-motorla-x-phone-and-its-going-to-level-the-playing-field/)**

I'm still don't know enough about the X Phone to formulate a rounded opinion on it, but my interest is piqued. I like the idea of being able to [customize device hardware](http://androidandme.com/2013/03/news/rumor-motorola-x-phone-brand-devices-will-have-user-customizable-hardware/) based on your needs/wants; phones are basically computers now, anyway. Motorola isn't exactly a manufacturer I attribute good looking devices to. However, Google has started taking hardware design more seriously so perhaps it's not something to worry about. I'm very curious about how the X Phone will coexist with current and future Nexus devices, as well. Lots of questions and not many answers, naturally. Hopefully Google I/O reveals something more.

* * *

**[Jony Ive is pushing for flat design now that he works closer to the iOS interface team](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/apple-jony-ive-ios-design-interface/)**

Good. No one should be subjected to ridiculously skeuomorphic apps like [podcasts](http://www.niemanlab.org/images/podcasts-screen.png) (which has been [updated recently with a tweaked UI](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4132866/apple-updates-its-controversial-podcasts-app)).

* * *

**[Dying vet writes a letter to Bush and Cheney](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dying_vets_fuck_you_letter_to_george_bush_dick_cheney_needs_to_be_read)**

I don't normally write or post about anything related to politics, but this is a really powerful letter. I highly recommend reading it.

* * *

**[George RR Martin says he needs to write faster](http://mashable.com/2013/03/22/game-of-thrones-george-martin/)**

"No shit," says everyone who has read the five available Song of Ice and Fire books.

* * *

**[A timeline of how everything spiraled out of control because of a sexual joke at PyCon](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/)**

This was a big fiasco in the tech world last week. I don't want to say too much about it because there are a lot of components to the story and I don't want to color any of it with my personal biases. This timeline does a good job of summing everything up and linking to appropriate sources.

* * *

**[NYC's subway to get giant, interactive touch kiosks with interactive maps, alerts, and service announcements](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57575798-1/new-york-subway-to-get-massive-navigation-touch-screens/)**

And, as a New Yorker, I have to wonder how long will it take before these things are horribly vandalized. I wonder the same thing about the [touchscreen directories that are replacing phone booths](http://mashable.com/2012/04/09/nyc-touchscreen-phone-booth/) in the city. Don't get me wrong, I love initiatives like this--I'm a geek after all--but as a NY-er I have to be a bit skeptical about it, too.

* * *

**[Screens made out of sapphire may be on the horizon](http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/21/tech/mobile/sapphire-smartphone-screens/index.html)**

> "a sapphire smartphone screen wouldn't break when you dropped it and couldn't be scratched with a car key or by a sidewalk"

For this reason alone, I can see these screens taking off… unless Corning comes up with something to one up sapphire, which wouldn't surprise me, either.

* * *

**[HBO Go could become available sans cable](http://mashable.com/2013/03/22/hbo-mulls-making-hbo-go-available-to-non-cable-subscribers/)**

Wise move—there's plenty of people out there who would subscribe just for Game of Thrones. Plus, HBO needs to contend with services like Netflix.

* * *

**[Lockheed Martin will start using quantum computers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/technology/testing-a-new-class-of-speedy-computer.html)**

This one's a bit over my head, but I do know that quantum computers will be magnitudes better than the current computers we use. To see an organization like Lockheed Martin commit to them so readily is a good sign for the technology.

* * *

**[Google Play Store is getting an update](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/20/possible-google-play-store-version-4-0-spotted-in-the-wild-with-new-holo-user-interface/)**

Looks kind of boring compared to the current Market, actually. As a designer, consistency isn't something I can ever complain about, though.

* * *

Thanks for tuning in. If you enjoyed the round up, feel free to [follow me on twitter](twitter.com/brentmeyer); that tends to be the social network I'm most active on.

See you next week.
