This morning, I dropped an envelope into a box--two stamps, the envelope fat from the folded paper within. I scribbled a destination on the front, hoping the chubby envelope will pass through the right hands to arrive at its intended reader.

Six pages make quite a bundle. I needed a second opinion on whether one stamp would suffice. One would've been a gamble, two would ensure its delivery.

I spent the the previous evening filling that envelope one letter, one word, one sentence, one paragraph, one page at a time. I wrote those six pages in the most archaic sense, using paper to suck up ink from a pen.

Why hand write a letter? Why not save time by typing it? Why not ensure its legibility by doing so? Why make the reader wait on the message and remove the opportunity of an immediate, timely response?

The limitations of the hand written letter are what make it perfect. To write the letter one must take time to do so, lest the scribbles become impossible to decipher. In taking the time, not only are words passed on to the reader, but a certain care is imparted between each uneven or tilted line.

There is an intimacy in revealing your handwriting to the recipient. Do you know what the handwriting of each of your friends looks like? Of all your family members?

The letter is a long distance secret, its contents sealed with actual DNA from the writer. The envelope reveals the letter's promise; your address in the center and mine in the corner--this is from me to you and no one else. 

And the greatest joy, of course, is opening the letter, knowing from the outside where it came from, preparing for the words within, and holding the paper the writer held to read the words written for you, the reader.
