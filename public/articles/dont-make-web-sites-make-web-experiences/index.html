				<p>Somehow, 2011 disappeared. It slipped away from us as we watched a glowing ball descend, while we stared at a countdown or clock, while we waited for a kiss when the numbers changed. It slipped away silently as we grasped for 2012, bubbling in a glass flute, waiting for us to drink it in.</p>
				
				<p>Many of us will resolve to be healthier, to take nothing for granted, to travel, or to finally do that thing we've been putting off. Statistically, that list will soon be forgotten. It's the spirit behind those resolutions that we need to hold on to.</p>
				
				<p>Stay eager to grow; stay eager to improve. Keep that fire alive that burned in those last few moments of 2011. Reach out and grab this year&mdash;snatch it and hold it&mdash;and make it yours.</p>
				
				<p class="big_text dark_blue">Happy Twenty Twelve.</p>
